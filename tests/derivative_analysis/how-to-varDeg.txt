The function varDeg gives the relation between two variables from their traces.

Args: list of variables, trace of variable 1, trace of variable 2, . . .

For example: If a program has three variables x, y, and z and the traces are:

x = [1,4,7,10]
y = [1,16,49,100]
z = [2,20,56,110]

First load varDeg.py using the command exec(open("varDeg.py").read()) in python
Then run the function varDeg as follows:

varDeg(['x','y','z'],[1,4,7,10],[1,16,49,100],[2,20,56,110])

For this particular traces varDeg output is:

y = 1+(5.0)*(x - 1)+(1.0)*(x - 1)(x - 4)
z = 2+(6.0)*(x - 1)+(1.0)*(x - 1)(x - 4)

These equations may not be correct 100% of the time. But the more important observation 
is rate of change, and the rate of change will be correct. For example, for this particular
traces:

rate of changes of z with respect to x is of order 2
rate of change of y with respect to x is of order 2

So, we expect the invariants to have a maximum degree of 2. The invariants are:

y = x^2;
z = x + y;

We see that the maximum degree in the invariants is indeed 2.
